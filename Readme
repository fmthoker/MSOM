(1)   Compile the program using 
	gcc som.c -lm

(2) To change the structure of the system change the respective MACROS at the top of the file

(3) Run the program using following command 
	./a.out train_PA-D.dat 
  Use the file given by professor 

(4) Now to test the system for case M=4, g=2, N=2 using data form a 3 non overlapping areas of a input cube
(change INP_DIM to 2, G_DIM to 2 and PARTNERS to 2)

run the program using ./a.out non_over_lap_area

This file contains the data taken uniformly form 3 non overlapping areas
Area1 x between(2,6) and y between(0,4)  
Area2 x between(10,12) and y between(20,22)
Area3 x between(14,18) and y between(30,35)

with 333 unifrom entries form each area

(5) The final centres will be written to file output_file

(6) Also attached is the python script to generate more such non-over lapping data files

scrpit_non_overlap_data.py
